title: 'Open Referral Google'
---

<p>This is a project for developing Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) implementations that run on the Google platform--this project is entirely managed via <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-google">its Github repository</a>. This is designed to be a team effort, so if you see a project you'd like to know more about, and maybe one you'd like to tackle, submit an issue!</p>

<p><strong>Google Services</strong></p>
<p>These are the Google solutions that are currently being used or considered as part of delivering projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/" target="_blank"><strong>Compute Engine</strong></a> - Run VMs on Google's infrastructure</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank"><strong>App Engine</strong></a> - PaaS for apps and backends</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/" target="_blank"><strong>Container Engine</strong></a> - Run containers on GCP</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/"><strong>Cloud Endpoints</strong></a> - Develop, deploy and manage APIs on any Google Cloud backend</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/" target="_blank"><strong>Cloud Storage</strong></a> - Object storage with global edge-caching</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/" target="_blank"><strong>Cloud SQL</strong></a> - Fully-managed MySQL and PostgreSQL database service</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/dns/" target="_blank"><strong>Cloud DNS</strong></a> - Reliable, resilient, low-latency DNS serving </li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/" target="_blank"><strong>Monitoring</strong></a> - Monitoring for applications on GCP & AWS</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/" target="_blank"><strong>Logging</strong></a> - Logging for applications on GCP & AWS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong></p>
<p>These are tools that are used as across any of the sub-projects included in this project.:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.openapis.org/" target="_blank"><strong>OpenAPI Specification</strong></a> - An API specification format used to define the request and response model for the API.</li>
  <li><a href="http://json-schema.org/" target="_blank"><strong>JSON Schema</strong></a> - A vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.</li>
  <li><a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/" target="_blank"><strong>HSDS OpenAPI</strong></a> - The OpenAPI definition for the HSDS API, providing a blueprint for the request and response structure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://openreferral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/#objects-and-fields" target="_blank"><strong>HSDS Schema</strong></a> - The schema documentation for HSDS, providing the details of the storage and transmission of data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
<p>These are the individual projects that are being built, or considered being built on Google:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HSDS PHP API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in PHP, that would run on Azure.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Portal</strong></a> - A generic portal that can be stood up in front of any API deployed on the Azure platfrom.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS Node.js API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in Node.js, that would run on Azure.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS Ruby API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in Ruby, that would run on Azure.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS Python API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in Python, that would run on Azure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>These are the communication channels used as part of this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-google/issues" target="_blank">Github Issues</strong></a> - This is the Github issues for this repository, which is used as issue and discussion management for any HSDS Google project -- each project will have it's own issues, but this is meant to be the discussion at the top level.</li>
  <li><a href="https://openreferral.slack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Open Referral Slack</strong></a> - The Slack Channel for the Open Referral organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop code and stories around using HSDS on the Google platform. Right now we are focusing on a simple server-side API implementation, but will be looking at serverless approaches using all the different cloud services that Google offers.</p>
<p>If you have a suggestion for a project, or want to get involved with any of the existing projects, just ping us on one of the channels above, and we'll see about getting you plugged in.
